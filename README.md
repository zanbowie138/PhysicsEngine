# PhysicsSimulator
An engine created with OpenGL and C++ that explores the graphics pipeline and computational physics from the ground up.

<br>

## Current features:
1. Rendering using Blinn-Phong shading with textures and custom shaders.
2. Uses an ECS (Entity Component System) for entity management and fast object manipulation.
3. STL model loading <a href="https://github.com/zanbowie138/STLFileReader">(using this custom loader)</a>
4. Broad-phase collision testing using both static and dynamic bounding volume hierarchies.
5. GUI created using [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

## Future Additions:
1. Rigidbody collisions
2. Cloth, fluid simulations
3. More complex model loading
4. Monte Carlo style raytracing
5. Multithreading
